As a project developer for Bus Mall I notice the catalogs are expensive to print and distribute. Since we are a startup and need to be careful with spending, I'm creating a catalog of items that are most likely to sell.

As a research team we need an analysis on the proposed products to test the interest with customers.

As a focus group participant I will be looking at three products at a time side by side, out of 25 pictures, I'm choosing 1 of those products in each slide of 3 that I'd most likely purchase.
